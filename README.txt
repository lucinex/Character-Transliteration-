Hindi - English Character Transliteration Model built as intern during Covid under IIT Guwahati. The tensorflow implementation works well, the pytorch one need to be debugged. 
The dataset is provided along. 
Ive used Bi-Lstms with Attention on the corpus both at word and character level and checked the accuracy over a range of 1000 sample. 

(Need to refactor the code more)
